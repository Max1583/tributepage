        Stan Lee, born(December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American
        comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the
        ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' primary creative
        leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a
        publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics
        industry. He was the primary—at times, sole—writer for Marvel in the
        1960s when the company was becoming Marvel Comics. He was involved in
        the co-creation of almost all of the company’s most well-known
        characters, from Spider-Man to the X-Men, with Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and
        the Avengers in between, to name but a few. His work was at once funny,
        melodramatic, and effortlessly charming, all while he and his many
        collaborators redefined the entire superhero genre.
      </p>
      <p>
        In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists
        Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous popular fictional
        characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor,
        the Hulk, Black Widow, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil,
        Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. These and other characters'
        introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach than
        previously to superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the
        restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes
        in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel
        properties in other media, with mixed results.
